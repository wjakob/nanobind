    nanobind/intrusive/counter.h: Intrusive reference counting sample
    implementation.

    Intrusive reference counting is a simple solution for various lifetime and
    ownership-related issues that can arise in Python bindings of C++ code. The
    implementation here represents one of many ways in which intrusive
    reference counting can be realized and is included for convenience.

    The code in this file is designed to be truly minimal: it depends neither
    on Python, nanobind, nor the STL. This enables its use in small projects
    with a 100% optional Python interface.

    Two section of nanobind's documentation discuss intrusive reference
    counting in general:

     - https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ownership.html
     - https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ownership_adv.html

    Comments below are specific to this sample implementation.

/** \brief Simple intrusive reference counter.
 *
 * Intrusive reference counting is a simple solution for various lifetime and
 * ownership-related issues that can arise in Python bindings of C++ code. The
 * implementation here represents one of many ways in which intrusive reference
 * counting can be realized and is included for convenience.
 *
 * The ``intrusive_counter`` class represents an atomic counter that can be
 * increased (via ``inc_ref()``) or decreased (via ``dec_ref()``). When the
 * counter reaches zero, the object should be deleted, which ``dec_ref()``
 * indicates by returning ``true``.
 *
 * In addition to this simple counting mechanism, ownership of the object can
 * also be transferred to Python (via ``set_self_py()``). In this case,
 * subsequent calls to ``inc_ref()`` and ``dec_ref()`` modify the reference
 * count of the underlying Python object. The ``intrusive_counter`` class
 * supports both cases using only ``sizeof(void*)`` bytes of storage.
 *
 * To incorporate intrusive reference counting into your own project, you would
 * usually add an ``intrusive_counter``-typed member to the base class of an
 * object hierarchy and expose it as follows:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include <nanobind/intrusive/counter.h>
 *
 * class Object {
 * public:
 *     void inc_ref() noexcept { m_ref_count.inc_ref(); }
 *     bool dec_ref() noexcept { return m_ref_count.dec_ref(); }
 *
 *     // Important: must declare virtual destructor
 *     virtual ~Object() = default;
 *
 *     void set_self_py(PyObject *self) noexcept {
 *         m_ref_count.set_self_py(self);
 *     }
 *
 * private:
 *     nb::intrusive_counter m_ref_count;
 * };
 *
 * // Convenience function for increasing the reference count of an instance
 * inline void inc_ref(Object *o) noexcept {
 *     if (o)
 *        o->inc_ref();
 * }
 *
 * // Convenience function for decreasing the reference count of an instance
 * // and potentially deleting it when the count reaches zero
 * inline void dec_ref(Object *o) noexcept {
 *     if (o && o->dec_ref())
 *         delete o;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you could also inherit from ``intrusive_base``, which obviates
 * the need for all of the above declarations:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * class Object : public intrusive_base {
 * public:
 *     // ...
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * When binding the base class in Python, you must indicate to nanobind that
 * this type uses intrusive reference counting and expose the ``set_self_py``
 * member. This must only be done once, as the attribute is automatically
 * inherited by subclasses.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * nb::class_<Object>(
 *   m, "Object",
 *   nb::intrusive_ptr<Object>(
 *       [](Object *o, PyObject *po) noexcept { o->set_self_py(po); }));
 * ```
 *
 * Also, somewhere in your binding initialization code, you must call
 *
 * ```cpp
 * nb::intrusive_init(
 *     [](PyObject *o) noexcept {
 *         nb::gil_scoped_acquire guard;
 *         Py_INCREF(o);
 *     },
 *     [](PyObject *o) noexcept {
 *         if (!nb::is_alive())
 *             return;
 *         nb::gil_scoped_acquire guard;
 *         Py_DECREF(o);
 *     });
 * ```
 *
 * For this all to compile, a single one of your .cpp files must include this
 * header file from somewhere as follows:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include <nanobind/intrusive/counter.inl>
 * ```
 *
 * Calling the ``inc_ref()`` and ``dec_ref()`` members many times throughout
 * the code can quickly become tedious. Nanobind also ships with a ``ref<T>``
 * RAII helper class to help with this.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include <nanobind/intrusive/ref.h>
 *
 * {
 *     ref<MyObject> x = new MyObject(); // <-- assigment to ref<..> automatically calls inc_ref()
 *     x->func(); // ref<..> can be used like a normal pointer
 * } // <-- Destruction of ref<..> calls dec_ref(), deleting the instance in this example.
 * ```
 *
 * When the file ``nanobind/intrusive/ref.h`` is included following
 * ``nanobind/nanobind.h``, it also exposes a custom type caster to bind
 * functions taking or returning ``ref<T>``-typed values.
