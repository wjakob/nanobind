*nanobind* is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice
versa. It is reminiscent of `Boost.Python
<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html>`_ and `pybind11
<http://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_ and uses near-identical syntax. In
contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is *more efficient*: bindings
compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have better
runtime performance.

More concretely, :ref:`benchmarks <benchmarks>` show up to **~4× faster**
compile time, **~5× smaller** binaries, and **~10× lower** runtime overheads
compared to pybind11. nanobind also outperforms Cython in important metrics
(**3-12×** binary size reduction, **1.6-4×** compilation time reduction,
similar runtime performance).

nanobinds depends on

- **Python 3.8+** or **PyPy 7.3.10+** (the *3.8* and *3.9* PyPy flavors are
  supported, though there are :ref:`some limitations <pypy_issues>`).
- **CMake 3.15+**.
- **A C++17 compiler**: Clang 8+, GCC 8+, MSVC2019+, and the CUDA NVCC compiler
  are officially supported. Others (MinGW, Cygwin, Intel, ..) may work as well
  but will not receive support.
