_nanobind_ is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice
versa. It is reminiscent of
[Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/python/doc/html) and
[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and uses near-identical syntax.
In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient: bindings
compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have better
runtime performance.

More concretely,
[benchmarks](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html) show up
to **~4× faster** compile time, **~5× smaller** binaries, and **~10× lower**
runtime overheads compared to pybind11. nanobind also outperforms Cython in
important metrics (**3-12×** binary size reduction, **1.6-4×** compilation time
reduction, similar runtime performance).
